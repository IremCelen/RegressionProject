# Regression Project

1.	A manufacturer of a certain product measured the amount of yield loss per hour from their factory production.  In addition to the yield loss, the manufacturer measures other variables associated with the production process.  These variables include:
<ul>
 <li>	RPM:  the speed controller set point </li>
 <li>	Temp1:  the temperature at the beginning of the process </li>
 <li>	Temp2: the temperature at the end of the process</li>
 <li>	Flow:  the set point of the water flow through the process</li>
 <li>	Conc:  the concentration of the main raw material</li>
 <li>	Line:  production line in the factory</li>
 <li>	Operator:  operator of the production line</li>
 <li>	Vacuum: categorical indicator of the level of vacuum used in the process</li>
 <li>	Vendor:  supplier of the main raw material</li>
</ul>
 Determine the best model for estimating the yield loss using the process data provided in the data file “YieldLossData.xlsx”.  

2.	Data was collected from various electronic inverters in order to determine the relationship between design variables and the transient point (voltage).  The design variables measured include:
<ul>
<li>	WidthNMOS:  the width of the NMOS device </li>
<li>	LengthNMOS:  the length of the NMOS device </li>
<li>	WidthPMOS:  the width of the PMOS device</li>
<li>	LengthPMOS:  the length of the PMOS device</li>
<li>	Setpoint:  The set point for particular inverter unit</li>
</ul>
Determine the best model for estimating the transient point using the data file “InverterData.xlsx”.
